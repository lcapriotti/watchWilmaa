Shell script to stream Wilmaa IPTV channels

Requires curl and ffmpeg

The script can be easily used with tvheadend creating an IPTV MUX and using an URL similar to:

pipe:///_path_/wilmaa2mpegts.sh -c _channelID_ -q 1080p50

Logic and process adapted from https://github.com/sunsettrack4/telerising, I am giving all credits to the author of that nice package.
